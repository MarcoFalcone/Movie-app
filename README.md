#React movie app

A react movie app is not something very unique, you've probably already seen it somewhere on the internet but I am a huge movie fanatic and I could not resist to make one. Fortunately I don't mind writing my own CSS, actually I enjoy it very much, so that allowed me to give it my own personal touch.

In this second app built with React I covered some more advanced topics:
Hooks - UseState, UseEffect;
Asynchronous js using fetch(), async and await;
Higher order js functions - map() and filter();

API used for the project - https://www.themoviedb.org/
