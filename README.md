# React movie app

A react movie app is not something very unique I know, you've probably already seen it somewhere on the internet but I am a huge movie fanatic and I could not resist to make one. Fortunately I don't mind writing my own CSS, actually I enjoy it very much, so at least I was able give it my own personal touch while still maintaining the look of the most popular streaming services. This app is connected to a public movie database and you can search for a specific movie, swipe through the genres and add your favorite movie to a list.

In this second app built with React I covered some more advanced topics:
 - Hooks - UseState, UseEffect;
 - API requests using fetch(), async and await;
 - Higher order js functions - map() and filter();

API used for the project - https://www.themoviedb.org/
